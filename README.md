 In this game you are the sun. Since you are stationary, you must
defend yourself by blowing up the asteroids. Asteroids that hit you
may take off a certain amount of health based on the asteroids size.



Watch out for planets and aliens that come to block your shots.

Break asteroids and rack up that high score! Good Luck.
